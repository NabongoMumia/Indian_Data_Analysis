## Project Overview 📊

The project spans the years 2018 to 2021, and it's designed to accomplish two main objectives: data handling and in-depth analysis. Our journey unfolds as a thrilling expedition through these milestones:

### 1. 🤔 Asking Relevant Questions and Hypotheses

**🧐 Questions:**

- Do companies in specific sectors receive more funding than others?
- Is there a correlation between a company's development stage and the funding it receives?
- Does the number of founders impact funding?
- What's the connection between a company's location and its funding?
- Does the number of investors influence funding?

**🧪 Hypotheses:**

- E-commerce and fintech startups receive more funding than the technology sector.
- A positive correlation exists between the development stage and funding.
- Companies with more founders receive higher funding.
- Major metropolitan areas attract more significant funding.
- The number of investors correlates with funding.

### 2. 📚 Packages & Libraries

Our toolkit includes powerful Python libraries:

- Pandas 🐼
- Scipy 📈
- Seaborn 📊
- Matplotlib 📉
- Scikit-learn 🧠

### 3. 🧹 Cleaning the Data

We kick things off by giving our data a good scrub:

- Replacing missing values
- Dropping duplicates
- Restructuring columns

### 4. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Our journey continues with deep dives into the data:

- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis

### 5. 📊 Statistical Testing

We employ various statistical tests such as T-tests and Pearson correlation to validate our hypotheses.

### 6. 📈 Answering Questions with Visualizations

Our insights come to life through captivating visuals:

- Violin plots 🎻
- Box plots 📦
- Bar charts 📊
- Scatter plots 🌐

### 7. 🌟 Power BI Deployment

We take our analysis to the next level with Power BI's Python scripting tool:

- Interact with the Dashboard here [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzBjNDVmNjctYTc1Mi00NGRiLThjYzMtOTVhZThjNjNkNDM5IiwidCI6IjQ0ODdiNTJmLWYxMTgtNDgzMC1iNDlkLTNjMjk4Y2I3MTA3NSJ9)
